How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it shows the "diff"erences between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    find new errors faster, add/remove features, easier colab

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    program does not know whne a commit is to small/big, also manual commiting allows for commit messages.
    auto commints cant be as valuable as maunal ones

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    for multy file projects it can be very usefull
    for automated version control its hard...

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log  	##shows changes (id,date, author, COMMIT MESSAGE!) 
    git diff <id1> <id2>	##shows changes between the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    can always change back to working code!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    all my programming actually!
